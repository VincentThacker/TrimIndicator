# Trim Indicator

A minimalistic KSP add-on displaying trim values inside the control gauges and adding fine trim controls. Trim is displayed in percentage i.e. -100.00 to +100.00. Fine trim controls enable changes of 0.01 and 0.05 (smallest change in stock is 0.20).
Display of wheel trim (throttle and steer) can be toggled by changing the `ShowWheelTrim` setting in `TrimIndicator.settings` to `True` or `False`.
